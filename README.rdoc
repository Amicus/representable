=Quick Start Guide

This is a short usage example. See ROXML::ROXML_Class and packaged test cases for more information.

Consider an XML document representing a Library containing a number of Books. You
can map this structure to Ruby classes that provide addition useful behavior. With
ROXML, you can annotate the Ruby classes as follows:

  class Book
      include ROXML

      xml_attribute :isbn, :from => "ISBN"
      xml_text :title
      xml_text :description, :as => ROXML::TAG_CDATA
      xml_text :author
  end

  class Library
      include ROXML

      xml_text :name, :from => "NAME", :as => ROXML::TAG_CDATA
      xml_object :books, :of => Book, :as => ROXML::TAG_ARRAY, :in => "books"
  end

To create a library and put a number of books in it we could run the following code:

  book = Book.new()
  book.isbn = "0201710897"
  book.title = "The PickAxe"
  book.description = "Best Ruby book out there!"
  book.author = "David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Dave Thomas"

  lib = Library.new()
  lib.name = "Favorite Books"
  lib << book

To save this information to an XML file:

  File.open("library.xml", "w") do |f|
      lib.to_xml.write(f, 0)
  end

To later populate the library object from the XML file:

  lib = Library.parse(File.read("library.xml"))

Similarly, to do a one-to-one mapping between XML objects, such as book and publisher,
you would use the *xml_object* annotation. For example:

  <book isbn="0974514055">
    <title>Programming Ruby - 2nd Edition</title>
    <description>Second edition of the great book.</description>
    <publisher>
      <name>Pragmatic Bookshelf</name>
    </publisher>
  </book>

can be mapped using the following code:

  class BookWithPublisher
      include ROXML

      xml_name :book
      xml_object :publisher, :of => Publisher
  end

Note: In the above example, _xml_name_ annotation tells ROXML to set the element
name to "book" for mapping to XML. The default is XML element name is the class name in lowercase; "bookwithpublisher"
in this case.
