Planned:

v 2.4
 * Test out compatibility with ActiveRecord such that it's easy
   to have both xml & database-sourced objects

 * provide an overridable extension point for the #to_xml-ing of
   values.  This would enable easy accommodation of non-standard formats.
   For example, formatting a number with leading zeros.

v 2.5
 * xml_convention(s) method for establishing whether names are
   camel-case, underscored or whatever, which will make the :from
   defaulting much more effective

 * on array types, check if there's a plural wrapper for :from, and
   take from it if it's there, which will remove the need for a lot
   of :from => 'Item', :in => 'Items' args

v 3.0
 * remove deprecated functionality

 * Perhaps provide cleaner separation between the specification
   of type vs its source in the XML.  For example,

     xml_reader :count, :from => 'Count, :in => 'Attributes', :as => Integer
     xml_reader :count, :attr => 'Count, :in => 'Attributes', :as => Integer

   become:

     xml_reader :count, Integer, 'Atributes/Count'
     xml_reader :count, Integer, 'Atributes/@Count'

   potentially backward-incompatible change.  Needs some thought...

Potential:

 * Add shorthand support to hash declaration

 * :as => :self for sending method_missing to this attribute
